#  ***Paradise Pending...*** :sunny: **Porfolio Project 5 @ Code Institute**

- <mark>Paradise Pending</mark> is an online e-commerce clothing store. My thought proccess behind Paradise Pending was to code a bright, happy clothing store with a hint of deep refelction and hope for that feeling of Paradise. I wanted the users to feel as if Paradise was just on the horizon and that no matter how down you may feel right now, paradise is always just around the corner.
I wanted the clothes to have a summer vibe to it as Summer seems to be the time of the year when most are happy. Summer brings the feelings of Paradise and happiness to most people With the bright sun and the blue skies. I wanted the clothes to reflect this and bring a summer feel, along with the idea and reminder to everyone that things can always get better and that feeling of Paradise is always close by. My idea is to have different clothing drops for differnt seasons of the year. Paradise can come in all of the four seasons but for now I decided to focus on the summer vibes.

- <mark>Paradise Pending</mark> has been developed for my Portfolio Project 5 for Code Institue Full Stack Software Deveoper Course using Django, HTML, CSS, JS & Python. As of now this is a fictional Clothing Store for educational Purposes. Any payments made using a valid debit/credit card will not be processed and the card will not be charged. No orders made will be fulfilled.

# **2. User Experience (UX) :art:**

## **2.1. The Strategy Plane**
The idea for Paradise Pending was to code a fully functional e-commerce store, where users can buy clothes. As stated above I wanted the Store to feel fun, happy and give summer vibes. I wanted the user to feel as if Paradise is pending and it is just around the corner no matter how they may feel at any given moment. For now I wanted the summer feel as most people related Paradise to Summer - Enjoying fruity drinks on the beach and chilling in the sun. Going foward I would like to have a different vibe and feel to the site for different seasons.

### **2.1.2. The Ideal User**
My target audience is everyone. No matter what age or gender you are Paradise Pending is for everyone.

- Ideal user likes the idea of Paradise 
- Ideal user like graphic tees and comfy joggers
- Ideal user likes the idea that Paradise is always just around the corner

### **2.1.3 Site Goals**
- To provide quality clothes for users (This is a fictional educational only website clothes are not for sale)
- To provide a quick, clear, and effiecent way to purchase clothes
- To be able to navigate the site with ease
- To be able to contact us if the user has any queries
- To be able to write reviews 
- To provide the users with our message that Paradise is Pending


### **2.1.4 Epics**
After thinking about my project, 9 Epics were created for this project. These Epics were the main sections of the TParadise Pending project. You can view the Epics via the KanBan board for this project. The Epics consisted of :

- EPIC 1 : Inital Setup + Settings
- EPIC 2 : Apps
- EPIC 3 : Templates
- EPIC 4 : Viewing & Navigation
- EPIC 5 : Sorting and Searching 
- EPIC 6 : Purchasing and Checkout
- EPIC 7 : User Accounts, Autehntication, Authorization & Registration
- EPIC 8: SEO & Web Marketing

  ![Epics](documentation/epics_pp5.png)

 ### **2.1.5 User stories**

 I had a total of 30 User Stoires for this project. I categorized them via Must-Have -- Should-have -- Could have -- & Wont have.
Must haves were Crucial for this project. Should-haves were I should have this but it is not the end of the world if I do not. Could haves were if I thought something could be in my project, It would be nice to have it but it does not need it. Wont haves were user stories that I wont have in my project due to time restraints or the skills to be able to do it as of now.

**MoSCoW prioritization technique stands for**:

**Must-Have**: Critical requirements that must be implemented for the project to be considered successful.

**Should-Have**: Important requirements that are not critical but add significant value.

**Could-Haves**: Desirable features that would be nice to have but are not crucial.

**Won't-Have**: Features that are explicitly excluded from the project scope.

## **2.2. The Scope Plane**

The scope of this project was to try and nail down the Stripe API and to deliver a fully functional e-commerce website. Since this was my first time implementing Stripe it was the main focus. MVP was the goal for this project due to time restraints. Anything more would be a big bonus :smile: 

The scope plans contained the following features to be added.

### Features to be implemented
- User Accounts with AllAuth
- Payment system with Stripe
- Reviews with full CRUD 
- F.A.Q Section
- Contact form for users to ask and send over questions
- Product inventory management - Full CRUD
- Fully functioning bag and checkout proccess
- Site responsivity

## **2.3. The Structure Plane**

**The structure of Paradise Pending is consistent, predictable, learnable, and visible, all in the best way using Bootstrap for styling and layout.**

It involves a nice clean header with the Paradise Pending logo at the far left. Alongside the logo is links to the Home page and a clothing dropdown menu where the user can pick which category of clothing they want to look for. On the right hand side then we have a 'My account' dropdown menu where users can register, Login, or logout. Beside that is that shooping bag that holds the users products in the bag itself, then lastly we have the Search bar for users to search products with.

The main section of the home page consists of a nice Jumbotron with some text and then a full width and height background image showcasing paradise pendings style.

Below that then we have the reviews section a nice card shaped area for users to look through reviews via the carousel.

Next, Is the f.a.q section, and finally we have a contact form section for users to contact us from.

At the bottom of the page we have a sleek footer. 

The header and footer are on all pages throughout the site, to keep it consistent. 

The clothing page itself has a structure of a card layout. Each piece of clothing has its own card layout involving a picture and the price and rating. 

The product detail page has a structure of the image of the product on the left, on the right is a description of the product and all the neccessary details. 

The bag and checkout structure is clean and easy to navigate for the users.

## **2.4. The Skeleton Plane**

###  Wire-frames

**I used Balsamiq for my wireframes. This is what I came up for Paradise Pending :**



## **3.5. The Surface Plane**

From the beginning of the project, I knew that the color palette would reflect summer vibes, lots of bright colors to indicate Paradise to the users. I wanted to give a happy positive look to the surface plane. 

I used bootstrap set colors for most of the website. I used the 'warning' color for the buttons and links on the site along with the shopping bag logo. I wanted to keep the colors as consistent as possible. 

 ![Colors](documentation/color_pp5.png)

Black (text-dark) or white (text-light) was used as the main colors for text. These colors give the best contrast.


 ![Colors](documentation/color_2_pp5.png)

SuperUsers also have the links to product managment in here. Beside 'My Account' is the shopping bag and then alongside that is the search bar.
